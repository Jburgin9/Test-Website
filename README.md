Building a website using the MongoDB, Spring, Java & Docker.
MongoDB & Express GUI is being housed on a Docker container, housed locally.
The goal of this site is to provide stock option ideas to users who register.
Over the past 2 years I've been trading stocks & crypto and have grown an interest
to continue trading. While my knowledge is limited, I would like to share some of
my trade ideas to others in hopes that they could observe and take action if
they desire.
